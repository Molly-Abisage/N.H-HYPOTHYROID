# N.H-HYPOTHYROID
 Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients.
DESCRIPTION
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormone. Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to "run the body's metabolism," it is understandable that people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism.

You are a Data Scientist working for Nairobi Hospital and have been tasked to study the factors that affect one's condition given information on the patients status over the past. We are then to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid..*
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The following steps will be undertaken during this study:

Reading and exploring the dataset.

DATA CLEANING
Dealing with outliers, anomalies and missing data to answer the given question.
Perform univariate, bivariate analysis and multi-variate analysis and recording observations.
Building Decision Tree models using the advanced models and optimizing them.
Identifying which of the models used is the most effective
Using the mentined model to select the most important features that are impactful in prediction.
Building SVM Models using the linear, polynomial and the radial basic function.
Compare the model with the features selected.
Challenge our solution and give futher information as to how we could improve the model.
